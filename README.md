## HH Global QA Automation Framework

This project demonstrates a Playwright-based test automation framework for testing the [HH Global website](https://www.hhglobal.com) across desktop and mobile devices.

## üéØ Objectives

- Validate that key UI elements render and function as expected.
- Confirm navigation works across desktop and mobile views, including the hamburger menu.
- Establish a scalable foundation for broader test coverage.
- Showcase how Playwright can be used effectively for cross-device QA.

   cd hhglobal-playwright
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Install browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```
4. (Optional) Install the [Playwright Test for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright).

## üåê iOS and Cross-Platform Testing

While Playwright‚Äôs device emulation reliably validates responsive layouts, especially with the Chromium and Mobile Chrome projects, I would recommend using a 3rd party tool like Browserstack for running tests on real devices. I would especially recommend this for iOS devices. Playwright‚Äôs Mobile Safari emulation is not reliable, and the only way to test on Mac operating systems from a PC would be to use a tool like this. Also, using Browserstack can help catch touch-specific and rendering issues that emulators may miss. When running the tests for this project, I recommend running the desktop tests with Chromium (`--project="chromium"`) and mobile tests with Mobile Chrome (`--project="Mobile Chrome"`).

**To run only desktop tests:**

npx playwright test tests/desktop --project="chromium"

**To run only mobile tests:**

npx playwright test tests/mobile --project="Mobile Chrome"

## üß≠ Overview of Test Coverage

### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Tests

- **home.spec.ts**: Smoke test to confirm homepage loads (checks page title).
- **ui-elements.spec.ts**: Verifies navigation bar, hero banner, and footer visibility.
- **homepage-desktop.spec.ts**: Tests hero section, data cards, contact form, map, and footer links.
- **navigation-desktop.spec.ts**: Validates top-level menu and submenus.
- **navigation-hamburger-desktop.spec.ts**: Checks hamburger menu visibility and navigation when resizing.

### üì± Mobile Tests

- **home.spec.ts**: Smoke test confirming homepage loads.
- **ui-elements.spec.ts**: Checks key homepage elements on mobile.
- **homepage-mobile.spec.ts**: Validates hero section, cards, contact form, and footer.
- **navigation-mobile.spec.ts**: Verifies hamburger menu expands and navigation works.

---

## üõ† Helper

**helpers/acceptCookies.ts**: Addresses the cookie consent overlay across all tests.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Playwright Configuration Notes

To improve reliability on my development machine, I adjusted the config:

- Timeout increased from 30,000ms to 90,000ms.
- Retries set to 2 (default was 0).
- Worker count limited to 3 (default was 4).

*Note:* When writing or debugging new tests, I set retries to 0 to catch all failures.

## Scalability Strategy

Here are some key factors I would focus on when designing a scalable test framework:

**Test Organization:**
Tests could be structured by feature area rather than just desktop vs. mobile, making the suite intuitive and maintainable. For example:

```
/tests
  /homepage
    hero.spec.ts
    navigation.spec.ts
    cards.spec.ts
    footer.spec.ts
  /who-we-are
    company.spec.ts
    strategic-partners.spec.ts
    sustainable-growth.spec.ts
    inspiring-solutions.spec.ts
    leadership.spec.ts
  /what-we-do
    creative-digital.spec.ts
    conscious-creative.spec.ts
    technology.spec.ts
    procurement.spec.ts
    logistics.spec.ts
  /case-studies
    case-studies.spec.ts
  /news
    news.spec.ts
  /careers
    careers.spec.ts
  /common
    contact-forms.spec.ts
    language-selector.spec.ts
    footer-links.spec.ts
```

This makes it easy to expand as new pages, flows, or components are added without cluttering the project.

**Tagging & Filtering:**
Instead of having separate desktop and mobile folders with a lot of duplication across folders, I could apply test.describe tags or naming conventions and use Playwright‚Äôs --grep flag to run targeted subsets (like desktop, mobile, smoke tests, regressions). So, for example, all describe() blocks would have either @desktop, @mobile, etc, and then use --grep to focus as needed when running tests. (Example: npx playwright test --grep @mobile)

**Reusable Helpers:**
Common actions, such as accepting cookies, interacting with the language selector, or validating contact forms, are consolidated into the helpers/ directory. This avoids duplication and ensures consistency across all specs.

**Page Object Models:**
As the suite grows, implementing Page Objects for key pages like the homepage, navigation bar, and contact forms, etc. will further improve readability and maintainability. Page Objects put all the page‚Äôs buttons, links, and actions together in one place. This makes your tests easier to understand and quicker to update when something on the page changes.

**Device Cloud Integration:**
(Using a 3rd party tool for testing on iOS and other actual devices)
When ready to expand to real devices and test iOS devices more reliably, the framework should integrate seamlessly with BrowserStack or Sauce Labs. (My experience has been with Browserstack) We can switch to running tests on real hardware by updating the Playwright configuration to connect to a remote wsEndpoint, with no changes required to the test logic.

**Continuous Integration:**
Running tests through a CI pipeline (such as Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions) increases reliability by ensuring tests always run in a clean, consistent environment. This helps catch issues early and reduces the chance of local setup differences causing problems. This also ensures that tests can be run in a clean environment whenever code changes, which would reduce the chance of missed issues.

## ü§ñ AI Use Disclosure

To ensure transparency, here is how AI tools were used on this project:

**Template Generation:**
AI was used to help create the initial boilerplate code for Playwright test files.

**Selector Research:**
Occasionally used AI to help identify recommended page elements and selectors while inspecting the DOM.

**Refactoring:**
Assisted in consolidating the logic for accepting cookies into a reusable helper function.

**Troubleshooting:**
Provided recommendations for handling timing issues, overlays, and improving selector reliability.

**Documentation:**
Helped outline and refine the README and supporting notes.
All code, configurations, and documentation were either created, edited, or reviewed and finalized manually to ensure accuracy and maintain full ownership of the solution.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Contributions

Here‚Äôs what I personally built and reviewed in this project:

- Designed the framework with desktop and mobile folders initially, and developed a feature-based folder strategy to support future scaling.
  
- Developed all test cases by analyzing the page DOM, finding stable selectors, and adding them to the project structure.
  
- Created and configured the Playwright setup, including adjustments to timeouts, retries, and worker limits for better reliability.
  
- Wrote a reusable helper function for accepting cookies to avoid duplication.
  
- Solved the challenge of testing the hamburger menu across desktop and mobile devices, making sure navigation worked consistently everywhere.
  
- Verified tests in Chromium and Mobile Chrome environments to cover multiple viewports.
  
- Researched and applied the right wait conditions to handle dynamic content and overlays.
  
- Created the Scalability Strategy to outline how the framework can grow, including plans for Page Objects and CI integration.
  
- Reviewed and finalized all code and documentation to ensure clarity, maintainability, and accuracy.
